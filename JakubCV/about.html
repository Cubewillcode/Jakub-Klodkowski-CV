                    <p>
                        I am very keen to learn and progress with my skills.
                        I am just a guy who is tired of bad choices and bad jobs and decided to do something about it. I
                        am passionate about technology, computers especially. Recently I got diagnosed with sleep apnoea
                        which
                        actually helped me improve my life and get new energy because looking back on previous years I
                        have
                        been
                        suffering from it for a long time. That has stopped me from improving my life a considerable
                        amount.
                        I
                        have been gaming mostly throughout my life but I realised that this is not something that will
                        take
                        me
                        anywhere. I was always been curious about programming and web development but never thought that
                        I
                        am
                        good/smart enough to do it. It was actually my friend and some people that I have met that have
                        convinced me to try it and I got hooked. I studied languages (Russian and English) and a bit of
                        engineering although I did not get a degree.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My interests are quite broad, I like: gaming, the whole fantasy subject including books and
                        movies,
                        history, science, psychology, combat sports - martial arts, cycling, motor industry, military
                        weapons,
                        tanks and so on, music - playing guitar and singing (not good at it at all but I still love it).
                        Recently I have spent my time only coding and creating first websites and have not looked back.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So I have decided to try and become a developer. At first I chose Java. After a break I have met
                        a
                        quite
                        experienced developer who invited me to try and make a game using Python and offered to help me.
                        I
                        really liked python. I bought some udemy courses to help me with the basics. After
                        some research and friednly advice I realised I should choose one of three main paths. Those are
                        web
                        development, applications or functional programming. I decided to go with web development as I
                        saw
                        the
                        most possible overlap with what I was thinking about before I started and was advised that HTML
                        itself
                        is very easy. I was always thinking on how some websites are very bad and I was convinced that
                        if I
                        could make web content I'd make it better. Because all websites at the very root use HTML, CSS
                        and
                        JavaScript I decided that I have to learn those first and then proceed with frameworks like
                        Angular.
                        Along the way I also realised that I will need some graphic design skills and UI/UX design. So
                        my plan now is to become a Front-end Developer who is responsible for the design and layout of
                        the
                        website more than the actual functionality. Then follow up with sharpening my Python skills and
                        maybe
                        databases.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Also, if that is relevant, I have good knowledge of local area and have my own transport so I
                        could
                        visit potential clients if that is needed of me.
